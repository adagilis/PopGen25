This page will slowly be populated by useful pieces of software, guides, tutorials and other little bits that you might find useful for self-study or use in your projects.

1. `Julia` - this is the programming language I will be writing most code in. If you'd like to get started with Julia but have no prior programming experience, check out [this guide](https://techytok.com/from-zero-to-julia/). On the other hand, if you already know how to program and want to know why `Julia` might be a good fit for you, check out [this more advanced guide](https://www.matecdev.com/posts/julia-tutorial-science-engineering.html).

2. Introduction to the shell - For those of you who have never used CLIs (command-line-interfaces), it might be useful to take a look at Software Carpentry's guide to the Unix shell: [link](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

3. If you are a Windows user and are not sure how to access the Unix shell - [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
