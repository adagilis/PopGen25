Here you'll find links for the labs on Thursdays, although they should all be available if you pull the latest version of the git before class time as well.

## Pluto

Some labs we will run using `Pluto` - an interactive notebook that uses `Julia` as the programming language, and will let us get on the same page faster for certain pieces of code.

To get runnning with Pluto, you'll just want to follow the guide at [Pluto's website](https://plutojl.org/#install).

Once Pluto is running, load in the lab `.jl` file provided for each lab and we'll work from there!
