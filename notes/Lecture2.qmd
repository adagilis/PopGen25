# Lecture 2: Describing genetic diversity

## Genetic diversity writ large

Last week you learned how different evolutionary forces affect allele frequencies at a single site.

. . .

This week, we'll be discussing how we can measure genetic diversity and what those measurements can tell us.

. . .

We will look at a few statistics that measure genetic diversity, notably the SFS, $\pi$, $\theta_W$ and $H$

## Measuring diversity at a site

Before we think about what's happening across genomic regions, we can start by asking what is happening at an individual locus.

## Recall

We will refer to the allele frequency of the *alternate* allele at site *i* as $p_i$.

What are some ways we can ask how diverse a population is at site *i*?

## Heterozygosity (*H*)

One of the simplest metrics is to ask how frequently we see individuals who are heterozygous.

. . .

$$
H = P_{Aa}
$$

Where $P_{Aa}$ is the frequency of heterozygotes.

. . .

If we are in HW (or close to), this should just be: $2p_i(1-p_i)$.

. . .

In practice - often not the case.

. . .

Also - does not work in ploidy != 2 (haploids, polyploids).

## Heterozygosity (\$\\pi\$)

Another way to think about genetic diversity is to ask:

What is the probability that if you sample any two alleles in the population, they are different.

. . .

In an infinite population, this is simply:

$$
\pi = p(1-p)+(1-p)p = 2p(1-p)
$$

. . .

Equal to heterozygosity in large populations under HW.
