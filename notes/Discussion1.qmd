# Paper Discussion 1

Today we will discuss XXX. 

The goal of these discussions is to understand how the pop-gen concepts we learned about last week help us understand evolution w/in populations.

Your quiz asked you if small or large populations should evolve more rapidly, all else being equal.

This paper asks if sexual/asexual populations evolve in the same way, all else being equal.

## The setup

Experimental design

## Why yeast?

Can manipulate sexual/asexual reproduction.

. . .

Can get many generations quickly.
