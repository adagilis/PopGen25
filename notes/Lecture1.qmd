# Pre-amble

## Welcome to the class

- Welcome to Population Genetics, EEB5348!

- Before we begin, some general logistics of the course.

- The course will consist of a weekly lectures, paper/methods discussions and a lab.

## Grading

- Grades will consist of 
    1. Participation in discussions. (24%)
    2. Weekly lab assignments/quizzes. (24%)
    3. Two minor homework assignments. (25%)
    4. One final project. (25%)
- And two free points!
- Fully half the grade will depend on a project, so what is the project?

## Assignments/Project
The goal is to create a small set of scripts that you have for many basic population genetics tasks.

. . .

We will assume you have called variants _somehow_. We sadly don't have time to teach you how to call variants on the many approaches one could.

. . . 

You will develop scripts to calculate basic population genetic statistics, plot them, and perform statistical comparisons when possible in each weekly lab.

. . .

Two incremental code base submissions in which I'll test your code on different data than used in class.

## Project cntd.

Your term project will be to fully analyze the genetics of a population of your choice.
    - Examine genetic diversity and its distribution
    - Run basic demographic analysis
    - Selection scans
    - etc.
. . .

You will meet with me half-way through the semester to decide on a tractable data-set, or I will provide you one

## What language should I code in?

The nature of this course is to help you develop tools useful for _you_, and so no single language is being prescribed.

. . . 

I will personally write code in both `Julia` and `R`, but pretty much anything here should be achievable easily in `python`, and with a bit more elbow grease in any language you desire (but I really can't help you if you decide to go for `Haskell` or something).

. . . 

Beyond that you will need at least a passing familiarity with `bash`, as some of the tools we'll run are only really acessable via CLI, and if these terms are sounding scary - we'll have a bootcamp this Friday.


## Schedule

- 12 regular weeks, 2 project focused

- You can find the schedule on the [course website]("link")

Population genetics is the anvil on which evolutionary intuition is developed.

Many verbal models that sound reasonable don't work once formally considered.

Pop-gen models specifically consider how evolution actually proceeds and affects genetic variation.

## What are models?

A model is a simplified version of reality.

In pop gen, we generally deal with three types of models:
    1. Explanatory
    2. Predictive
    3. Statistical
